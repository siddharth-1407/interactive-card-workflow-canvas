# Workflow Canvas

Workflow Canvas is an app for visually organizing tasks, projects, or ideas. 

## Features

- **Add and Manage Cards** : Users can add cards containing dummy text, with only a portion displayed initially and a "Show More" button to reveal the full content in a modal popup.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality** : Cards can be freely dragged and dropped anywhere on the canvas, allowing users to organize their workflow visually.
- **Re-sizable Cards** : Each card is resizable, providing flexibility in how much space each content block occupies on the canvas.
- **Connect Cards with Arrows** : Users can create connections between cards using arrows, enabling them to visually map out relationships between different content blocks or to create a workflow.
- **Scroll-able Canvas** : The canvas is fully scroll-able, ensuring that users can navigate through their workspace even when it extends beyond the initial view-port.
